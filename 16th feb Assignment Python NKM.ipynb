    "Ans:- A database is a collection of data that is organized and structured in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that manages the storage and retrieval of data in a database. Databases are used to store a variety of information, including customer information, product information, financial information, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two different types of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on the relational model of data, where data is organized in tables with predefined relationships between them. SQL databases use SQL to manipulate and retrieve data, and they have well-defined schemas that define the structure of the data in the database. Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use SQL for querying and manipulating data. NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as key-value stores, document stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. NoSQL databases are often used for storing and managing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is the way they handle data relationships. SQL databases use a well-defined schema to enforce relationships between tables, while NoSQL databases often store data in a denormalized way, allowing for more flexible and scalable data structures. Additionally, NoSQL databases are often more scalable and can handle larger amounts of data, while SQL databases are typically better suited for complex queries and data integrity enforcement."

Primary keys are used to ensure the integrity of the data in the table and to enable other tables to establish relationships with the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table of employees, the \"employee_id\" column can be used as the primary key, as each employee in the table will have a unique ID number. This allows other tables to reference the employee table by the \"employee_id\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table. A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by allowing one table to reference the data in another table. The table that contains the foreign key is called the \"child\" table, and the table that contains the primary key is called the \"parent\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have two tables: \"employees\" and \"departments\". The \"employees\" table contains an \"employee_id\" column as its primary key, while the \"departments\" table contains a \"department_id\" column as its primary key. If we want to establish a relationship between these tables, we can add a \"department_id\" column to the \"employees\" table as a foreign key that references the \"department_id\" column in the \"departments\" table. This allows us to associate each employee with a department.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table, while a foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by allowing one table to reference the primary key of another table. Primary and foreign keys are fundamental to the structure and design of a relational database."
